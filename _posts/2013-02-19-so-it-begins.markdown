For the first time, I have launched something that I am planning to charge money for. You know what, scratch that. Actually it is the first time I have seen something till the end.

It has been only 3 days since the "launch" and I have already realized that partial completion of arbitrary feature list is not the end, it is actually far from it.  When you "launch" a web application, that launch doesn't really mean anything. No one knows about it, no one is visiting it, no one is searching for it. And that's where the actual start is, a start to gather visitors and a start to convert those visitors into paying users.

Shipping a product is just a small step, on a very long road ahead. And I have decided to document this journey, on this blog. I plan to write everything, every idea I am thinking of, my rationale behind that idea. Most importantly, how I am putting that idea into practice and the results that I am getting.

It is going to be an fun ride, you will either see rise of something remarkable or it will just fade away. In either case, you will get to learn something good from it. So, now will be a good time to bookmark this blog or for to [subscribe](http://feeds.feedburner.com/websymphony) to the feed. ;)

So without further ado, let me introduce you to the product. It is a simple application that lets you  create, manage and track Professional looking resumes. It is called [**HipCV**](https://hipcv.com), catchy name eh?! Only 5 characters long and it is actually related to the project. Already Winning!

Jokes aside, list of things that I have already done for the project till now:

* Well, I have squatted all the possible online places by the name HipCV. [Twitter](http://twitter.com), [Facebook](http://facebook.com/hipcv), [Google+](https://plus.google.com/108449441565541919231/posts), [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com/hipcv) and maybe some more. Can't seem to remember all of them right now, but I guess you can find them when you search for [HipCV](http://www.google.com/search?q=hipcv) keyword. I did this because I thought when the someone will search for the site by name. All the top links that show up, should get people to the site somehow. And secondly every business has to have social presence, so why not.
* Put a stop on my never ending feature list and have shipped a minimal product that I think, provides something of value to the users.
* I did an exhaustive research on competing products and services. Most of them are charging monthly fees, so I am planning to compete on price by giving the product out for one time payment and with almost the same feature set.
* Tried to promote it on reddit/r/startups, didn't get anything useful out. Was suggested to make the service free for few years and then charge money after I have users. Which I thought was a terrible suggestion, and bummed me out as well. So the pricing stayed.
* Did some search for sites that list newly launched websites. Found few of them, startupli.st, startuptunes are the ones I sent email to. Haven't heard back yet, so if app gets listed, that will bring some traffic I think. I found these sites from this onstartups [answer](http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/31787/are-there-any-blogs-or-websites-introducing-new-website).
* I was able to get it listed on [feedmyapp](http://feedmyapp.com/p/a/hipcv/26669) & [ziipa](http://ziipa.com/apps/hipcv), pretty excited about that.

Now, time for the results for past 3 days. Site had **63** unique visits, and yes that is apart from me checking the site constantly if it was still up in this overwhelming traffic. And out of those, **7** have signed up to try the product and created a resume. So I guess you could say things are getting pretty serious.

If you are in need of a stylish Resume, go and try [HipCV](https://hipcv.com).
