Hello, I am Amit Gaur, thanks for visting my site.

I am a Ruby/Rails/Front End Developer, with a keen eye for design.

My interest lies in creating products that are functional and have good design aesthetics. This site is a log of my journey as I try and learn new things.

Since now you know the reason behind this site, some interesting tid bits about me.

I was born and brought up in New Delhi, India. Came to United States in 2006 for my Master's in Computer Science at University of Cincinnati.

After finishing my Masters, I worked as an Applications Analyst / Front End Developer at University of Cincinnati for around 4 years. At University, I was lead developer for numerous public facing websites and web applications.

Currently, I am working as a Ruby/Rails Developer at Northwestern University Bio Informatics Center, Chicago.

**Skills I have acquired over the past few years (in no particular order):**

 * Hand crafting HTML, writing tons of efficient CSS/SCSS.
 * Converting design documents into tangible mockups and prototypes using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
 * Strong understanding of MVC design pattern.
 * Using jQuery as a tool to manipulate dom and ajaxifying the application.
 * Object oriented javascript.
 * Ruby & Rails.
