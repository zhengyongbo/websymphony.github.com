      <strong>This is an open invitation:</strong> if you want to talk software, products or technology, I want to talk to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      My email address is <strong>amitgaur.web[at]gmail.com</strong> <br>
      I have <strong>websymphony</strong> as handle on most social networks.  I prefer email, but if you want to just holler on twitter, that is cool too.

      I love talking about software, applications, technologies. If you are a startup, engineer, student, or a person interested in any of these and need someone to hash out ideas with. Or someone who just needs a second pair of eyes to review a design, test usability or functionality of something, feel absolutely free to contact me.

      I also like reading things, if you write something worth reading, tell me.
